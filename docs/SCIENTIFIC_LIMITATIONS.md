# Scientific limitations

The short list. Every number and its test is in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md); §8 (known limits) and §14 (*Find everything*) are the long forms.
A candidate is a lead with its evidence, never a discovery. Nothing this application has produced is an unknown object.

## Data

- The public demo runs on **synthetic** data. Real SPHEREx cutouts (60 small ones: Barnard's Star, Epsilon Indi B, WISE 0855, the asteroid Arosa,
  Makemake) are used only on the author's machine and are not published; their licence and terms of use have not been reviewed ([CREDITS.md](../CREDITS.md)).
- Fluxes are quick aperture sums on background-subtracted cutouts, 2-10 % below catalogue magnitudes, **not** SPHEREx's calibrated photometry.
- Through SPHEREx's variable filter each image of a star has a different wavelength, so its brightness changes from image to image: movers are
  found from **positions only**, and any flat-spectrum assumption (injection tests, the "absent in other passes" transient tag) is an approximation.
- A cutout of all detectors together and one of a single detector are resampled differently; marginal results can differ between them.

## Find movers

- Needs images from at least 3 survey passes about 6 months apart; motion below about 0.8 pixel (5″) over the baseline looks like a still star.
- In a field with a saturated star it is 20-30 times less sensitive; one image reaches about 0.6-0.9 mJy in a clean field.
- The "chance lines expected" number is conservative in the empty-sky tests; it is not a probability of being real.

## Planet X mode

- Works on bodies single images can show (about V 17). A Planet-Nine-like body (300-800 AU) is 3-5 magnitudes too faint for it (VALIDATION §11).
- Blind test on real Makemake images: default options found nothing; loosened options found it as 1 of 38 candidates, while an empty field gives
  about 33 chance candidates (§12). A candidate resting on 5 dots or fewer carries a caution in the interface.
- The Earth's position is a low-precision formula; the spacecraft's own position is not used (not verified).

## Find everything

- It lists what the images show and what the catalogues explain. On six real 5′ fields all 42 sources were explained; **it found nothing new, and
  that test cannot say whether it would**.
- Depth: a fixed source needs 3 individual detections (about 0.7-1.5 mJy in a clean field); a mover needs about 50 times the detector noise;
  brown dwarfs like WISE 0855 (about 0.4 mJy in a stack) are below it. Stacking would go deeper and is not done.
- The "needs checking" threshold (support 65 and present in 30 % of the images of its passes) lets through about 1 false lead per 21 empty
  fields on average, from 0.005 to 0.16 depending on the field. The score is a sum of documented terms, not a probability.
- Near a very bright star many real sources are classed "possible artefact" (35-65 % of injected ones in the Barnard fields): conservative on purpose.
- Catalogue epochs for 2MASS and AllWISE are approximate; a cut-short catalogue answer or SIMBAD alone cannot call a source new.
- The positions CSV is not an MPC/ADES report.

## Spectra

- The colour hint (flux at 4-5 µm over flux at 1-2 µm) cannot tell an M dwarf from an early T dwarf and is not a classification.
- Spectra are built from images taken at different times: a variable source mixes variability with spectral shape.
